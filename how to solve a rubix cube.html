    <p>this website shall be your guide on solving the rubix cube. If you dont understand any of the steps listed below in this website go to <a href="contacts.html">"My contacts"</a> and send me a message!</p>
    <p><em>this website is made by M.Mohamed Murshid, NoCopywrights included</em></p>

    <h1 class="topic">What you will need to know...</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>first of all, i will be using algorithm, or letters instead of typing all the things you need to know, that way it wont be very tedious work and i can finish this website quickly.</p>
      <p>so here are all the algorithms:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li class="algorithm">R|stands for right</li>
        <li class="algorithm">L|stands for left</li>
        <li class="algorithm">U|stands for up or top</li>
        <li class="algorithm">F|stands for front</li>
        <li class="algorithm">M|stands for middle</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>second of all, you will notice that i use this ' after the algorithm. it means that you have to turn it anti-clockwise. if you dont see it then it means you have to turn it clockwise</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>and third of all, if you're left handed, then change all the rights to left, that includes the intruction before the algorithm too, invert the clockwise or anti-clockwise.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>and finally, the piece with one face is called the middle, the piece with two faces is called an edge, the piece with three faces is called a corner. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h1 class="topic">Your steps to solving the rubix cube</h1>
    <p>follow these steps and you will solve the rubix cube in no time!</p>

    <h2 class="topic">Step 1: The white daisy</h2>
    <p>all you have to do in this step is to form a flower shaped pattern on the top or the one with the yellow middle and the white edged pieces facing upwards.</p>
    <p>you can do this by positioning the white edge pieces on the top</p>

    <h2 class="topic">Step 2: The white cross</h2>
    <p>This step is also pretty easy... position the flower such that one of the white edge pieces fit with the color of the middle piece.</p>
    <p>after you did that, turn the face 2 times, repeat with all the other edges.</p>

    <h2 class="topic">Step 3: The first layer</h2>
    <p>now here is where you will need to learn an algorithm. to those who think this step is easy, skip to the next step.</p>
    <p>to those who dont know how, place the corner piece above the place where it should be and use this algorithm, </p>
    <p class="algorithm">R|U|R'|U'</p>
    <p>or if you want a more faster way of doing this, You can also:</p>
    <p class="algorithm">R'|F|R|F'</p>
    <p><em>note that this is according to my personal opinion. just because its easy for me it doesnt mean the same for you.</em></p>

    <h2 class="topic">Step 4: The second layer</h2>
    <p>This step is not that hard, but if you really ponder upon it for some time, you will understand it. Anyways here are the steps:</p>
    <p>select an edge piece and turn the top until it matches with a middle piece.</p>
    <p>then check whether if you the piece should be fitted to the left or right side, if the piece should go to the right, then</p>
    <p class="algorithm">U|R|U'|R'|F|R'|F'|R</p>
    <p>If it should go to the left, then:</p>
    <p class="algorithm">U'|L'|U|L|F'|L'|F|L</p>

    <h2 class="topic">Step 5: The yellow cross</h2>
    <p><em>from now on, most of these, if not all of these next steps are all algorithms. so get ready and practice!</em></p>
    <p>there are 3 possibilities. either you have no edges facing up, or you have 2 edges facing up, or you already have the cross. if you do then skip this section, if you dont, read on.</p>
    <p><strong>possibility 1: two edges facing up</strong></p>
    <p>now there are two possibilities again. the first one being that the two edges maybe directly opposite or next to each other</p>
    <p>for the edges being opposite each other, use this algorithm</p>
    <p class="algorithm">F|R|U|R'|U'</p>
    <p>and for the edges being next to each other, position the top such that one of the edges is facing you and the other facing right, then use this algorithm</p>
    <p class="algorithm">F^2|R|U|R'|U'</p>
    <p><strong>possibility 2: no edges facing up</strong></p>
    <p>take any side and use this algorithm:</p>
    <p class="algorithm">F|R|U|R'|U'</p>
    <p>then use this algorithm:</p>
    <p class="algorithm">F^2|R|U|R'|U'</p>
    <p><em>now you might be wondering, why i used "^2". thats because i meant that you should turn the front along with the middle layer behind the front. now if you didnt uderstand what i said go to <a href="contacts.html">contacts.html</a></em></p>

    <h2 class="topic">Step 6: The yellow face</h2>
    <p>Now if you went to other websites or videos, you may not have seen this step but its a step that i understand better than others so i will go with this one.</p>
    <p>there are A LOT of possibilities in this so get ready... i think i will take some time to write this, its.... a lot so this is going to take a looooong time.</p>
